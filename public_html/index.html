             <p align="center">I was born March 10, 2000 in Glendale, California,<br />
                 USA. I spent my moving around from place to place in southern <br />
                California but I spent the majority of my childhood in Pasadena,<br />
                CA. I had made a YouTube Channel "Ricffris Gamesalot" in 8th grade<br />
                with gameplays inspiring me to make the things I love so much; <br />
                video games! My first experience with programming was in 8th grade<br />
                Robotics class with Mr.Crosby. There I had the help of his assistant<br />
                Grant and my colleges to learn how to and preform how to program NXT <br />
                robots. My team won second place in the annual robotics competition <br />
                of PUSD (Pasadena Unified School District). My school won every other <br />
                trophy and medal.Crosby was a very inspiring person, though he sugar <br />
                coated nothing, he opened my eyes to how this world works. I was <br />
                taught that in this world there are producers and consumers. And <br />
                I wanted to be a producer. Now I'm off to the right track by entering <br />
                the APP Academy teaching me more advanced coding tools than C language such <br />
                as HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. I am a programmer, and <br />
                I'm preparing for the future. In this world there are thinkers <br />
                and there are doers. And I ask myself "Why not be both?"</p>
