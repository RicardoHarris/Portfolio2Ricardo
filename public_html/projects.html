                This is my projects page. It displays the projects I've done so <br />
                far and the projects I'm going too be doing soon. This website  <br />
                is my second project this school year. My first project was also<br />
                a portfolio website. The difference between this portfolio site <br />
                and my last one is that in this one I am using more Bootstrap   <br />
                elements. "What is 'Bootstrap'?", you may ask, to learn more    <br />
                about bootstrap got to my Technology page. The link is found on <br />
                the left.
