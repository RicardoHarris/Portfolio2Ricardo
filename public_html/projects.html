                            I'd done. It pretty much just gave a bit of information <br />
                            about myself and showed you what I could do with basic<br />
                            coding this year. That was awhile ago but from that <br />
                            experience I was able to make this website.

                        <div class="col-xs-9">This is my second project and my <br />
                            second portfolio site. My experience with that helped<br />
                            me make this site. But there's a difference between <br />
                            the two. As you could probably tell, this site is a <br />
                            lot more cool tricks and is much better organised. <br />
                            That is because I am using Bootstrap! "What is bootstrap?",<br />
                            you may ask. Bootstrap is a free collection of tools<br />
                            containing HTML and CSS based design templates. It <br />
                            makes websites super fancy. Like this one. So, this <br />
                            projects is the same as the first one but fancier.</div>
