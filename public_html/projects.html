                            My portfolio site was the first <br />
                            I'd done. It pretty much just gave a bit of information <br />
                            about myself and showed you what I could do with basic<br />
                            coding this year. That was awhile ago but from that <br />
                            experience I was able to make this website.
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-xs-3"><h2>Portfolio 2</h2></div>
                        <div class="col-xs-9"><img class="img-responsive img-rounded" src="css/images/PortIndex2.png"><br />
                            This is my second project and my <br />
                            second portfolio site. My experience with that helped<br />
                            me make this site. But there's a difference between <br />
                            the two. As you could probably tell, this site is a <br />
                            lot more cool tricks and is much better organized. <br />
                            That is because I am using Bootstrap! "What is bootstrap?",<br />
                            you may ask. Bootstrap is a free collection of tools<br />
                            containing HTML and CSS based design templates. It <br />
                            makes websites super fancy and "responsive" meaning <br />
                            it makes our websites move to whatever you are using.<br />
                            Mobile, laptop, desktop, etc. All of th. Like this <br />
                            one. So, this projects is the same as the first one <br />
                            but fancier.</div>

                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-xs-3"><h2>Snake</h2></div>
                        <div class="col-xs-9"><img class="img-responsive img-rounded" src="css/images/SnakeEarlyScreenshot.png"><br />
                            My snake game was the first game I'd created. It's <br />
                            based upon the game "Snake" game made in the late 1970's<br />
                            based around a number of shapes that move around following<br />
                            one another moving like a snake. Every time it eats <br />
                            food it becomes one of those shapes longer. You lose <br />
                            you lose if you hit the wall or yourself. What differs<br />
                            this project from the portfolios, besides this one <br />
                            being a game, is that in this one I am using Javascript.<br />
                            Javascript is "an object-oriented computer programming<br />
                            language commonly used to create interactive effects <br />
                            within web browsers. Which pretty much means it makes<br />
                            objects on a website move through code. So my Snake <br />
                            game is based off of an html site just like my other <br />
                            two projects before this.</div>

                        <div class="col-xs-3"><h2>Mario</h2></div>
                        <div class="col-xs-9"><img class="img-responsive img-rounded" src="css/images/MarioScreenshot.png"><br />
                            My Mario type game, inofficially known as "Danger Dude"<br />
                            is a game, obviously, based off of the Mario Bros. <br />
                            franchise, by Nintendo. This game is a "side-scroller"<br />
                            type game, meaning it  moves across a side scroll. <br />
                            As my second game and my fourth project, I had the most<br />
                            fun making this game. For the first time, I'm most <br />
                            proud of everything in the project. What I mainly used<br />
                            to make this game was the game creation engine "Tiled"<br />
                            and the coding language "melonJS". In Tiled you can <br />
                            make maps for games of 2 and 3 dimensions using "tiles"<br />
                            which are basically sheets of custom design or "tilesets".<br />
                            I used tiled to create my game's levels. Tiled is <br />
                            very simple and can be used by anyone with or without<br />
                            tutorial. melonJS is an open-source HTML5 based community<br />
                            game engine. In other words you use it to make games<br />
                            with HTML. "Danger Dude" is based within html as well<br />
                            as my other projects.

                        Portfolio 3 was a reboot of my Portfolio 2 and an example<br />
                        of how I could use jQuery. I added a jQuery page to the <br />
                        Portfolio 2 which displayed elements of jQuery that I have<br />
                        learned and know how to use. I also added a few jQuery <br />
                        techniques into a few of my other pages.

                        My Blog, unofficially named "Commpunity" is a social <br />
                        network in which I used the coding language of php for <br />
                        the first time. It was challenging and exiting, I stayed<br />
                        a bit ahead of the class for this one as I enjoyed it so<br />
                        much. I plan to add more style to it. I had a very fun <br />
