                            My portfolio site was the first <br />
                            I'd done. It pretty much just gave a bit of information <br />
                            about myself and showed you what I could do with basic<br />
                            coding this year. That was awhile ago but from that <br />
                            experience I was able to make this website.
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-xs-3"><h2>Portfolio 2</h2></div>
                        <div class="col-xs-9"><img class="img-responsive img-rounded" src="css/images/PortIndex2.png"><br />
                            This is my second project and my <br />
                            second portfolio site. My experience with that helped<br />
                            me make this site. But there's a difference between <br />
                            the two. As you could probably tell, this site is a <br />
                            lot more cool tricks and is much better organized. <br />
                            That is because I am using Bootstrap! "What is bootstrap?",<br />
                            you may ask. Bootstrap is a free collection of tools<br />
                            containing HTML and CSS based design templates. It <br />
                            makes websites super fancy and "responsive" meaning <br />
                            it makes our websites move to whatever you are using.<br />
                            Mobile, laptop, desktop, etc. All of th. Like this <br />
                            one. So, this projects is the same as the first one <br />
                            but fancier.</div>
