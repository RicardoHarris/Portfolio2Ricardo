                            <p>HTML5 (or "HyperText Markup Language") Is what I 
                                mainly use to make websites. It provides me with<br />
                                the text you see and the links to different websites.
                                It works hand in hand with other coding tools, such<br />
                                as CSS and Bootstrap, to make websites like these possible.<br />

                            <p>CSS (or "Cascading Style Sheets") Is what I use to
                                add colors, borders, backgrounds, and much more. <br />
                                It pretty much adds style or "fance" to the website
                                It works with HTML sites to add these cool things.<br />

                            <p>Bootstrap is a free collection of tools for HTML 
                                and CSS. It makes websites like this "responsive"<br />
                                meaning it moves and adjusts to any size screen 
                                and adapts to mobile and computer settings. This<br />
                                is my first time heavily applying Bootstrap to a
                                project. It's very helpful and gives me fancy <br />
                                tricks to use such as jumbotron and responsive images.<br />

                            <p>Javascript is an object-oriented computer programming
                                language commonly used to create interactive effects.<br />
                                Its used to move objects across the screen. You
                                can do nearly anything with it. The possibilities<br />
                                are endless. I used it to make a game; snake. It's
                                an extremely complicated and advanced language.<br />

                                game engine. It's basically a language used to create<br />
                                games in HTML. It is a very complicated language 
                                truly based off of Javascript. It interacts with<br />
                                many other programs, hence "open-source". I used
                                it to create my "Mario" based game "Danger Dude".<br />

                                Tiled is basically a map editor for games. I used
                                this program for my "mario" game. It is simple to<br />
                                use and easily accessible. What you use in Tiled
                                are "tiles" or "tilesets" which are certain textures<br />
                                in a group of squares or cubes. I prefer using
                                tiled to create game maps.<br />

                                jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript
                                library. It makes websites more stylized and <br />
                                personalized by accessing html and css through 
                                Javascript. Though it is not a coding language <br />
                                on its own, more of a technique, it is very handy
                                and commonly used in stead of Bootstrap. Personally<br />
                                I prefer it over Bootstrap due to its convenience
                                and accessibility.<br />

                                PHP, or Hypertext Processor(Personal Home Page) 
                                is a popular general-purpose scripting language <br />
                                that is especially suited to web development. 
                                PHP is commonly used in the most powerful websites<br />
                                such as yahoo, Facebook, and YouTube. I used
                                PHP for my Blog, social network, website.This <br />
                                language is specifically helpful for those who would
                                like to save data from their site such as user <br />
                                data and accessing data. I like the simplicity
                                and compatibility of PHP. <br />
